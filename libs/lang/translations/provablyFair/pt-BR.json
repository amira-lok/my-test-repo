The result is calculated using the client and server data directly before the beginning of each game, so the player can see it immediately after opening the case.",
  "info.algorithmDescription3": "You will get an encrypted hash of the servers seed before you open the case or upgrade your items. In that way, the 100% fairness can be guaranteed. The initial and final hash values will be identical, which will prove that website do not interfere in final results. In order to check Provably Fair functionality, you need the data below. You can copy the JSON (game data) or use the data table. After that, you need to paste the data into the  input field, follow this",
